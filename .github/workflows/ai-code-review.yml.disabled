# AI Code Review Workflow - TEMPORARILY DISABLED
#
# This workflow has been disabled due to YAML syntax issues.
# The multi-line string handling in bash script conflicts with YAML parsing.
#
# To re-enable:
# 1. Fix the YAML syntax issues in the REVIEW_PROMPT section
# 2. Configure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in repository secrets
# 3. Rename this file back to ai-code-review.yml
#
# Original workflow attempted to:
# - Detect TypeScript/JavaScript file changes in PRs
# - Call Anthropic Claude API for code review
# - Post review comments on the PR
#
# For now, CI checks (linting, tests, build) are sufficient for merge approval.
